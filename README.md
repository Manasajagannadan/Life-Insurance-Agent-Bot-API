# Life-Insurance-Agent-Bot-API

Hi folks,

Today the above project explains the conversation between the client and the robot. The robot will ask the questions based on the client's responses and gives the result of whether the client is eligible for any insurance or not.

Got fruitful and satisfactory results.

Procedure:
1. Run the all .py files and check the results
2. mainly run Advanced_Chatbot_NLP_With_Voice.py file for final results.

Thank you. 

Happy learning.
