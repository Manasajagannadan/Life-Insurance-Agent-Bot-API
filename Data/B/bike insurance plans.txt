What Are The Types Of Bike Insurance In India?

What is bike insurance?
When you ride your bike on public roads, you are essentially exposing yourself and others to certain risks such as accidents, collisions etc. These events may happen either due to inexperience or negligence. In either case, total or partial damage to the bike and injury or even loss of life of the drivers involved can occur. In order to safeguard against such unfortunate events, bike insurance is a mandatory requirement.

In a bike insurance policy, the insurer promises to make good any expenses or liabilities that arise in respect of the insured bike. The policy is a contract between the insurance company and the policyholder wherein the former offers insurance coverage in return for the regular and timely premiums paid by the latter. The extent and nature of coverage offered under a bike insurance policy will depend on the type of two-wheeler insurance opted for.
